    <P1>Welcome to my Docker Nginx website! This site is a simple demonstration of how to deploy a static website using Docker and Nginx. Docker allows for easy containerization of applications, making them portable and efficient to manage. Nginx, on the other hand, is a powerful web server that's perfect for serving static content like this webpage. Whether you're just starting out with DevOps or you're a seasoned professional, I hope you find this demonstration helpful and informative. Feel free to explore and learn more about the technologies used to build this site.</P1>
